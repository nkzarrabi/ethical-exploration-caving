                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>This isn't an indictment of explorers, cavers, or anyone for that matter. It's the beginning of a conversation—a call for us to confront the complex ethics that underpin our community. As cavers, we share a passion for the underground world, but we rarely acknowledge the moral gray areas that come with it.</p>

                <h2>First Discovery</h2>
                <p>I remember standing with my mentor, looking at a lidar map at a kiosk that now sits in a paved parking lot, once filled with gravel and construction equipment. The map, a modern tool of exploration, was new to me, but my gut told me that the spot my mentor pointed to wasn't what we thought. A month later, I found myself standing in a small depression in the earth, with the cold air swirling around me. I returned the next day with my shovel, determined to know the truth.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Soon after, the ground gave way to a small opening that we had never seen before. That was the start of my first significant discovery."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The Cost of Discovery</h2>
                <p>When I say soon after, I discount the hours of digging—what I call "shovel time"—spent late at night or in the rain, clawing through the earth until my skin burned.</p>
                <p>The thrill of discovery wasn't just about finding the cave;<br>
                My mentor and I were likely the first humans to ever set foot inside that pit.<br>
                A cave that I discovered, that he had no clue about. And he had seen it all!<br>
                Or so I thought..</p>

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>In the caving world, the motto "Leave only footprints" often feels like a guideline rather than a rule. When the passage is too tight, shovels, hammers, and sometimes even more extreme methods are employed. Some see this as a necessary part of pushing boundaries, while others keep surveys and cave details hidden to protect these fragile environments from potential harm.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "The question is, where do we draw the line between safety and preservation?"
                </blockquote>

            <section>
                <h2>The Path Forward</h2>
                <p>This isn't just about digging; it's about grappling with the broader question of how we define right and wrong in a community where everyone operates on different principles. Some cavers are willing to dig, blast, and modify the environment in pursuit of the next big discovery. Others view these actions as a violation of the very spaces we cherish and aim to protect.</p>
                <p>So, what's the best path forward? How do we reconcile these differing viewpoints? It's a question without a simple answer, but it's one worth exploring together. We've unearthed more than just rocks and soil; we've revealed the complex web of values and responsibilities that come with exploration.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "As a community, we must ask ourselves: are we prepared to live with what we leave behind?"
